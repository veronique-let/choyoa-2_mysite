## Hey there! 

Welcome to my personal website I have created for my ENVS 193DS class at UCSB!

\-\--

## A little about me and my background:

My name is Veronique Letourneau and I like to go by *V* . I am a SBCC transfer student currently completing my fourth year in Environmental Studies at UCSB. As lucky as I am to be able to attend this University, I cannot wait to hop into the "real" world after graduation!

\-\--

I have tons of hobbies and interests apart from my field of study, but one thing I absolutely love in life is being able to travel and capture my experiences through photography.
