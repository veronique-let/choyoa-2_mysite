I am a SBCC transfer student currently completing my fourth year in Environmental Studies at UCSB. As lucky as I am to be able to attend this University, I cannot wait to hop into the “real” world after graduation!\n---\nI have tons of hobbies and interests apart from my field of study, but one thing I absolutely love in life is being able to travel and capture my experiences through photography."
