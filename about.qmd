title: "About my travels"

Throughout the years, I have had the absolute privilege to be able to make my way around areas of the globe with a few of the best people in my life.

Following my move to California, my two best friends an I made a pact to meet each other in a new country every year and we have certainly followed it to a T.

From getting our Scuba certification in Belize in 2019, to hiking Machu Picchu last summer, we have have been able to explore and discover 7 different countries together before even turning 21!

So I am sharing some of my favorite memories I have captured throughout the years for two of my Top 3 trips!

Welcome, Enjoy and I hope this ignites the travel bug in you!
