We knew from then on that we had fallen in love with this corner of the world.\n\n\nAnd finally, the Costa Rican coast left us with an even more special sunset for our last night. Absolutely magical!"

I went with my 2020 Costa Rica trip and Peru 2023.\n\n\n\nMy Experience.\n8-10 sentences summarizing your experience, addressing (for example): What was hard about this? What was easy? What was new to you? What was familiar to you?\nI absolutely loved doing this project! It was hard at first to figure out exactly how to link the repo to a webpage, but once I had gotten that figured out, the ball was rolling! Everything about this assignment was new to me but in such an exciting way! I am honestly hoping to get to learn more about GitHub pages, this was an interesting thing to do. A major factor for my enthusiasm in doing this project was being able to look back at my travel photos and share with you! I am very proud of how it came out and have received very nice feedback from people around me finding it quite impressive! So fun:)"
